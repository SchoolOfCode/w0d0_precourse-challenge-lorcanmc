          AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go. It was
          developed by DeepMind Technologies a subsidiary of Google.
          <br /><br />
          Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including
          a version that competed under the name Master. After retiring from
          competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more
          powerful version known as AlphaGo Zero, which was completely
          self-taught without learning from human games. AlphaGo Zero was then
          generalized into a program known as AlphaZero, which played additional
          games, including chess and shogi. AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded
          by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the
          rules.
          <br /><br />
          AlphaGo and its successors use a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to
          find its moves based on knowledge previously acquired by machine
          learning, specifically by an artificial neural network (a deep
          learning method) by extensive training, both from human and computer
          play. A neural network is trained to identify the best moves and the
          winning percentages of these moves. This neural network improves the
          strength of the tree search, resulting in stronger move selection in
          the next iteration.
          <br /><br />
          In 2017, the Master version of AlphaGo beat the number one ranked
          player in the world at the time, in a three-game match. After the
          match, DeepMind retired AlphaGo, while continuing AI research in other
          areas. The self-taught AlphaGo Zero achieved a 100â€“0 victory against
          the early competitive version of AlphaGo, and its successor AlphaZero
          is currently perceived as the world's top player in Go as well as
          possibly in chess.
